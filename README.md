+ [Demo: end-to-end agentic development with GitHub Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVn-lnHZ9s) (5:19) - Your development environment is only a couple of clicks away, requiring no local installation. GitHub Copilot coding agent does more than just suggest code - it helps you triage issues, debug and run tests, and even acts as a peer developer, building code from issues you assign. See how GitHub Copilot keeps developers focused on building!
+ [How to automate code reviews and testing with GitHub Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDEGFNAUkX8) (4:35) - Code review and verification are just as important today as they were three years ago. GitHub Copilot can help with the process through code review and Autofix, catching both code and security flaws. Copilot lets you review its code and request changes just like you would with any other member of the team!
+ [Automate debugging with the Playwright MCP server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh9D3lQs3A8) (1:44) - The Playwright MCP server helps Copilot do more than just run tests. It can confirm and resolve bugs too. In this demo, we’ve shared a bug report with Copilot Agent Mode. Copilot used Playwright to reproduce the issue, confirm the bug, explore the project, find the root cause, apply the fix, and verify it worked. MCP servers expand what Copilot Agent Mode can do by giving it new skills as an AI peer programmer.
